## Motivation
I have a daughter entering her senior year of high school, and as we face one of the biggest decisions of her life, I am interested in helping her choose the best program possible, focus/limit the application process, maximize our budget for tuition with the best balance of debt and future earnings.
## The Questions
1.	What schools and/or degrees leave students in least debt? 
2.	Compare Public vs Private (not-for-profit) vs “Highly Selective” Schools. Is there a 'best value'?
3.	Is it cost effective to spend money on an elite institution?
## Data Sources
My project uses the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) dataset(s) collected by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). I also used the College Scorecard "Most Recent Data by Field of Study" to further my exploration of student loan debt and future earning power.
