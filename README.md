# College Tuition, Debt, and Future Earnings
Nashville Software School, Data Analytics Capstone Project


# Executive Summary
My proposal is based upon the College Scorecard dataset(s) and exploration of student loan debt and future earning power. Is college tuition still worth it and any guarantee of financial security? What fields of study improve this type of success?

# Motivation
I have a daughter entering her senior year of high school, and as we face one of the biggest decisions of her life, I am interested in helping her choose the best program possible, focus/limit the application process, while maximizing our budget for tuition (a plan for no scholarship or financial aid, just in case) with the best balance of debt and future earnings.

# Data Question(s)
o	What are the Degrees that “pay back”? 
o	What schools/degrees leave students in least debt? 

# IF POSSIBLE:
o	“Top Ten” (for example) Engineering programs for women?
o	Compare Public vs Private vs “Elite” Schools
o	Include graduation percentage and (average?) years to complete program?
o	How many years of work to pay off debt? 
o	What must graduate earn to make loan payment?

# Data Sources
Document the data you use and the source of that data (provide a link to the data when possible)

# Known Issues and Challenges
Explain any anticipated challenges with your project, and your plan for managing them.

I might need more data to support some questions, particularly to answer questions regarding women in engineering.
College Scorecard will have some difficulties in complete data analysis, as much is privacy protected and contains null values. Would appreciate any advice on how to rectify this or allow for these limitations in my final presentation.
I will need to spend time with the documentation to understand the data and interpret the cells; and what is being reported.
