# College Tuition, Debt, and Future Earnings by Field of Study
Nashville Software School, Data Analytics Capstone Project


# Executive Summary
My proposal is based upon the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) dataset(s) collected by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). I also used the College Scorecard "Most Recent Data by Field of Study" to further my exploration of student loan debt and future earning power. Is college tuition still worth it and any guarantee of financial security? What fields of study improve this type of success?

# Motivation
I have a daughter entering her senior year of high school, and as we face one of the biggest decisions of her life, I am interested in helping her choose the best program possible, focus/limit the application process, while maximizing our budget for tuition (a plan for no scholarship or financial aid, just in case) with the best balance of debt and future earnings.

# Data Question(s)
o	What schools/degrees leave students in least debt? 
o	“Top Ten” (for example) Engineering programs for women?
o	Compare Public vs Private (not-for-profit) vs “Highly Selective” Schools
o	Include graduation percentage and (average?) years to complete program?
o	How many years of work to pay off debt? 
o	What must graduate earn to make loan payment?

# Known Issues and Challenges
Explain any anticipated challenges with your project, and your plan for managing them.
I might need more data to support some questions, particularly to answer questions regarding women in engineering.
